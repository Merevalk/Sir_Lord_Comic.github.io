  <h3>Why Sir Lord Comic?</h3>


<div class="jumbotron">

<p>  Sir Lord Comic became a founder of the hip-hop dynasty with his release of Ska-ing West in 1963.  Hip-Hop was born in Jamaica almost two decades before the Fatback Band's King Tim III, A Corona Jam by Ronnie G and the SM crew, and most famously Rappers Delight by the Sugarhill Gang, which all came out in 1979. Even the precursor to Rap, the spoken word, which was practiced by The Last Poets and Gil Scott Heron did not appear until 1968 and 1970 respectively. The first hip-hop artists in the United States - DJ Kool Herc (Clive Campbell) and Afrika Bambaata were heavily influenced by the Jamaican sound system era, as Kool Herc was born in Kingston and was immersed in the Sound System culture until he was 12, while Bambaaata used Jamaican music to energize the earliest block parties.  Rapping and Toasting, or chanting over a beat, have their roots in ancient African musical Griot traditions, but gained a new energy with the Sound Systems (a generator, turntables, a 'selector' to choose and play the records, huge speakers, a microphone and a library of beats and riddims), and the influx of American vinyl and the music and dj jive talk programs being broadcast from radio stations in Memphis and Florida.   The first Jamaican hip hop artists such as Count Machukie, and Sir Lord Comic amalgamated these elements together to create and deliver rhymes over extensive music decades ahead of their American counterparts, making Sir Lord Comic a first among firsts.

  <div class="jumbotron">

<p>How Percival Wauchope became Sir Lord Comic is unknown, but it must have been around the time he started as a “legs man” dancing for Admiral Dean's sound system.  Inspired by Count Machukie, the Lord Comic's hip-hop career started on Christmas night in 1959 when the "selector" Willy Penny drank too much and the boss of the sound, Mr. Dean asked Sir Lord if he could manage. The Lord Comic went to Spanish Town Road to borrow a Grampian mic from a man called Nat King Prof. "I put on a record by Len Hope called, »Hop, Skip and Jump« when the tune started into about the fourth groove I says »BREAKS!« (laughs) when I say »breaks« I have all eyes at the amplifier, y'know. And I says »You love the life you live, and you live the life you love. This is Lord Comic,« That night was exciting, very exciting".  Over the next few years he would continue to articulate his personal musical style.  By 1964 he had composed most of his major tracks: Ska-ing West, The Great Wuga Wuga, Rhythm Rebellion, Jack of My Trade, and, "Four Seasons of the Year" that uses a backing track from one the most dynamic and brilliant musical ensembles to ever emerge from Jamaica - The Skatalites.  Although Count Machukie was the first hip-hop Deejay, his percussive bravado lyrics are more scattershot; Sir Lord Comic was the first to carpet a whole track with rhymes.

<h3>Hip Hop origins in Jamaican Ska </h3>

<h3>What the People Say </h3>
<div class="jumbotron">
<p>   
   Hip-Hop emerged from the Kingston sound system culture and from Ska.  When Count Machukie came to work for Tom Wong's "Tom the Great Sebastian" in 1950, the Sound systems were already in ascendant with Wong's selection of Merengue, Latin music and Rhythm & Blues blasting from electronics virtuoso Hedley Jones' custom built by speakers attracting a good cross section of the Kingston populace to come dance and party.  With more entrepreneurs entering the audio fray, the Kingston nights became saturated with the sounds of multiple Systems vying against each other with occasional violent results. 
  As competition intensified and Rock and Roll diverted and dried up the supply of Rhythm and Blues, some Sound System producers, such as Seymour Clement 'Sir Coxon' Dodd and Arthur Duke Reid, started to bring in local singers, mento, calypso and ex-jazz musicians to reinterpret R&B numbers. The recordings were pressed into one individual 45' that would be played exclusively over the respective sound systems. This process eventually begat Ska and made it the musical expression of Jamaican independance era with the island ending its status as a British colony on the 6th of August 1962. </p>


   <p>
   Hip Hop grew out of the Ska sound with artists like Count Machukie and Sir Lord Comic using its distinctive features to form their lyrics and to attract and energize the crowds.  The offbeat rhythm, the walking bassline, imported from jazz, and the unique drumming style conmbined to make a style of music flexible enough to allow space for brass musicians to improvise and to give gaps and breaks for deejays to fill with flows and with their own personal energy.  Count Machukie reached his style apotheosis after moving to "Sir Coxon" Dodd's sound system, just as Dodd was bringing together the talent that would come to define the Ska, and later Reggae, sounds. Sir Lord Comic maintained that his lyrics grew out of the ska rhythm, as every hip hop artist follows the rhythms of their era.  Ska soon fell out of fashion, but its hip hop offshoot would go on to exert great influence with the sound system concept transported to the South Bronx where it would develop into American hip hop.

Fats Domino was a musical astronaut and one of the earliest explorers of not only rock and roll, as well as its Jamaican variant. His influence on modern music cannot be overstated</p>

    <h5 class="card-title">Count Machukie</h5>
    <p class="card-text">Count Machukie was a hip-hop originator who lived for music. He got his start by toasting or adding talkovers to song tracks whenever the sound was weak or needed some vigour. The idea came to him after hearing radio jockeys in the United States talking over tracks, and from Muhammed Ali's short fluid rhyming style. Machukie developed these into his own style and breathed musicality into to create what would go on to become Rap and hip-hop. Unfortunately there are few recordings of the Count.</p>

<h3>Decline and Renewal</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="juggernaut">
  <div class="jumbotron">

<p>  As ska deaccelerated into Rocksteady, then evolved into Reggae, it mostly disappeared from the island, especially after the visit of Haile Selassie in 1966 and the heatwave of the same year.  Reggae would continue to grow globally as Bob Marley and his band the Wailers released To Catch a Fire in 1973.  Although the album was not popular in Jamaica, Eric Clapton made a hit cover of one its songs - I shot the Sherrif, and Bob Marley would go on to become a global music icon.  Jamaican Rap and Ska would remain more marginal until ska underwent a revival in the 1970's in the U.K. and in the 80's and 90's in the United States.  At the same time hip-hop was gradually growing into a global juggernaut and Jamaican artists would continue to absorb, develop and export their music.</p>
